                I'm currently looking for a{" "}
                <strong>software development internship</strong> for my LIA{" "}
                <i>(l√§rande i arbete)</i> for my education. The internship would
                run from october, 2025-10-13 to april, 2026-03-13. My education
                is in Java but I can take an internship in any related language.
                Ideally it would be a position in Uppsala but I am open to any
                close commutes or remote work.
