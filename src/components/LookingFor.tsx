                I'm currently looking for a{" "}
                <strong>software development internship</strong> as part of my
                LIA <i>(l√§rande i arbete)</i> for my education. The internship
                would run from October 13, 2025 to March 13, 2026. My education
                is in Java but I can take an internship in any related language or field.
                Ideally it would be a position in Uppsala but I am open to any
                close commutes or remote work.
