            <h4>Coding</h4>
            <p>
              I always try to learn a new skill or working on some small
              project. I often get lost in the sauce when I see something cool
              and I try to learn it for a week or two until I see something else
              cool and jump to that. I am an expert of having completed the
              first 25% of youtube courses. While this is not optional it's fun
              and I have a decent knowledge of many things. For some reason my
              goto project when learning a new language is an Elevator
              Simulator. It's a fun project both to test all the basics while
              having room for infinite expansion. I have done this in C#, Python
              and Java so far.

            <h4>Gaming</h4>
            <p>
              I do spend alot of my free time playing video games. Some of my
              favorite game in recent memory is Elden Ring, Final Fantasy XIV
              and Factorio. Since I have alot of gamer friends I also tend to
              just play whatever popular game we're playing at the time. Some of
              my most played games include Counter-strike 2, Dota 2 and
              Warframe.

            <h4>Music</h4>
            <p>
              Music is my biggest passion. When I was younger I played piano
              daily. I went to high school at IT-Gymnasiet in a special program
              called Music/IT/Multimedia. It's where I met alot of IT people and
              got my first introduction to coding. But it's also where I learned
              to play drums, guitar, bass, violin and evolved my piano skills.
              Nowadays I don't activly play any music myself but I still love
              listening to music and find new artist.

            <h4>Music again</h4>
            <p>
              I could probably add like 20 more of these cards just gushing
              about music I enjoy. I love finding new music and artist and I'm
              always evolving my taste. Thanks to Spotify and algorithms I have
              an avenue to explore all kinds of music. I can just match a song I
              know with a mood I feel like and use the "Go to song radio"
              feature to find new interesting artists. Then I can go to that
              artist and do a deep dive into their discography. This is how I
              have found many of many favorite artist of all time, but also how
              I created the problem discussing music with people since most
              people don't listen to obscure Japanese experimental orchestral
              bands.
